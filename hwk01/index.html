                This is Apple's AR/VR product view. I picked this experience because I think Apple made a very
                personal way of allowing potential buyers to experience their products and get a sense of scale and
                detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, other companies have used this marketing technique, however what's different in Apple's version, is
                you can view it in both AR (Object) and VR mode. Their AR mode is used to get a sense of it in your
                home, which conveniently includes photo capture and share buttons which will fade when not being used.
                VR mode allows you to view the product independently if you don't have or want a surface to view it on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both modes allow you to pivot and move products exactly how you want them in your own home, and zoom in
                to see all the tiny details you don't get to see in the ads. With this, customers can see how their
                products will look and fit into their homes and lives without having to buy it first.

            <h2 class="section_title">Origami Simulator</h2>
            <video autoplay loop muted class="shadow" src="./assets/origami-sim.mp4"
                alt="Origami Simulator Video"></video>

            <p>
                I take inspiration from Origami Simulator because they are setting out to make the best tutorial
                experience for Origami art. Having a VR style tutorial is very helpful as users can view an
                obstruction-less lesson on a very complex and particular art. This must be super helpful for small,
                complicated folds.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the UI/UX, the simulator allows 360 pivoting, grab and move, a reset button, and even includes a
                reset and a slider to control the progress of the fold, allowing users to build their own Origami at
                their own pace. A helpful design choice was to make one side of the paper pink to easily distinguish
                fold instruction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall I think Origami Simulator took an education route to the VR world and really thought about the
                needs and UX of their program.

            <h2 class="section_title">Dance Tonight</h2>
            <video autoplay loop muted class="shadow" src="./assets/dance-tonight.mp4"
                alt="Dance Tonight Video"></video>
            <span class="row button_wrap">

            <p>
                This experience inspired me because of how unique it is. As the player, you can be the yellow ball or
                any
                of the dancers in the simulation. I think this adds a unique perspective because you literally get to
                choose the perspective of the dance party at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sound is also very important in this experience, the animations are in sync with the music to help bring
                it to life, making for a really enjoyable VR experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of UI/UX, the camera angles are controlled, but not intrusive. Most entities are looking at the
                focus object (the yellow ball). You can hover over the entities that you can be, the shape will turn
                white on hover, indicating that you can be that POV.
            </p>
            <p>
                An important thing to point out is that even though the graphical detail is very minimal, the developers
                were obviously successful in personifying these simple forms into dancers. Proving that you don't need
                great graphical skills to make an enjoyable and usable VR experience.
